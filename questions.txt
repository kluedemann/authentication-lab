It is managed through Django's session authentication backend.

3. In Session Authentication the information is stored on server side, so it is stateful. 
When using Token auth, the server doesn't need to store anything, so it is stateless.
Stateless authorization is important because it allows the communication to be RESTful.

4. When you click "Log in with Google" in an OAuth2 flow, the following occurs:
    1) You are redirected to the authorization provider's (Google) authentication page.
    2) You enter your account credentials
    3) If you login successfully, an access token is given to your browser
    and you are redirected to the content page.
    4) Your browser includes the access token with subsequent requests 
    so that you can view authorized content.
